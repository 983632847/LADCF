Instruction for LADCF_HC Tracker:
Learning Adaptive Discriminative Correlation Filter on Low-dimensional Manifold (LADCF) utilises adaptive spatial regularizer to train low-dimensional discriminative correlation filters. We follow a single-frame learning and updating strategy: the filters are learned after tracking stage and then updated using a fixed rate [1]. We use HOG [2] and CN [3]. Code modules refer to ECO [4] in feature extraction.

Dependencies:
PDollar Toolbox [5], mtimesx and mexResize. 

Operating system:
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Matlab R2016a, CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2643
